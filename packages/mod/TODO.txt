- change characters
- player doesn't have shadow / weird overlap

- killing
- imposter thing where you close the doors
- imposter lights

- imposter should not get real tasks

- test to see ghosts in task mode, should not show

Future:

- rebuild walls manually on every room entrance
  (but first find a way to repro the bug where walls are randomly in the center of a 2x1 room?)

- add timing based task like the circles?
- add task like the vials where you have to wait 60 seconds (real task is 60 seconds)
