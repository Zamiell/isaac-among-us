TODO:
- bug: kill UI in shields exit
- vents
- imposter thing where you close the doors
- imposter lights

- change characters
- animation for when someone talks in meeting
- ctrl+shift+f TODO

Future:
- rebuild walls manually on every room entrance
  (but first find a way to repro the bug where walls are randomly in the center of a 2x1 room?)
- add task like the vials where you have to wait 60 seconds (real task is 60 seconds)
